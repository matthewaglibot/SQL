FROM db1.hr.jobs C
WHERE C.job_id = B.job_id) AS Avg_Salary
FROM db1.HR.employees A 
JOIN db1.hr.jobs B ON A.job_id = B.job_id
WHERE A.salary > (SELECT AVG((min_salary + max_salary) / 2)
                  FROM db1.hr.jobs C
                  WHERE C.job_id = B.job_id)


--2. Write a query to find the departments which do not have employees at all? (Use the db1.hr.departments,
--db1.hr.employees tables).

SELECT *
FROM db1.HR.departments A 
LEFT JOIN db1.hr.employees B ON A.department_id = B.department_id
WHERE B.department_id IS NULL



--3. Using the tables, db1.ncc.student & db1.ncc.registration which students were not enrolled in any courses

LEFT JOIN db1.ncc.registration B ON A.StudentID = B.StudentID
WHERE B.StudentID IS NULL




--4. Determine which books were published by the publisher of "The Wok Way to Cook". Use the table,

WHERE PubID = 4




--5. Display the ProductID, ProductName, and ProductPrice of the cheapest product. Use the table,
--db1.zagimore.product.

SELECT productid, productname, productprice 
FROM db1.zagimore.product
WHERE productprice = (SELECT min(productprice) FROM db1.zagimore.product)
