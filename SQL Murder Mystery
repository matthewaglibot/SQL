1. Using this query, we get a detailed description of the suspect based on what we know. 
The crime was a murder and it happened at SQL City on Jan.15,2018
SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report 
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City'
AND date = '20180115'


2. We need to now identify the initial suspect. Here, I will pull the 2 witnesses and there police report transcript.
First, identify the first witness by listing all the house numbers in 'Northwestern Dr' and listing them in descending order
Second, searching person named 'Annabel' who lives in 'Franklin Ave'
Third, we combine the data to display it as one result.

WITH witness1 AS 
(
SELECT * FROM person WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr' ORDER BY address_number DESC LIMIT 1
),
witness2 AS 
(
SELECT * FROM person WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave' AND name like '%Annabel%'
),
witnesses AS 
(
SELECT *,1 AS witness FROM witness1 UNION SELECT *,2 AS witness FROM witness2
)
SELECT A.id, B.transcript FROM witnesses A JOIN interview B ON A.id = B.person_id



3. First witness said he saw a 'man' with a 'Get Fit Now Gym' bag, with a membership number that started with '48Z' and a plate number with 'H42W'.
Second witness said that she recognized the killer from the gym when she was working out last Jan.9th

WITH evidence1 AS 
(
SELECT person_id, name, membership_status FROM get_fit_now_member WHERE id like  '%48Z%' AND membership_status = 'gold'
),
evidence2 AS 
(
SELECT check_in_date FROM get_fit_now_check_in WHERE check_in_date = '20180109'
),
initial_suspect AS 
(
SELECT A.name, C.plate_number, B.membership_status, (SELECT * FROM evidence2) AS date 
FROM person A 
JOIN evidence1 B ON A.id = B.person_id 
JOIN drivers_license C ON A.license_id = C.id
WHERE C.plate_number like '%H42W%'
)
SELECT * from initial_suspect



4. Now that we have our initial suspect, lets pull his police interview transcript
SELECT transcript FROM interview WHERE person_id = 67318



5. We learned that Jeremy was was hired by a woman, around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"), red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S and 
Attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

WITH evidence1 AS 
(
SELECT person_id, event_name, date, count(*) AS attendance FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert' 
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 3 
AND date like '%201712%'
),
evidence2 AS 
(
SELECT B.id AS person_id, B.name, A.gender, A.height, A.hair_color, A.car_make, A.car_model, B.ssn 
FROM drivers_license A
JOIN person B ON A.id = B.license_id
WHERE A.hair_color = 'red'
AND A.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND A.car_model = 'Model S'
AND A.gender = 'female'
AND (A.height >= 65 OR A.height <= 67)
0)
						 
SELECT B.name, B.ssn, A.attendance, A.event_name FROM evidence1 A JOIN evidence2 B ON A.person_id = B.person_id
